Data Journalism using d3.js:

A project centered around data-driven storytelling and interactive data visualization. Uses HTML, JavaScript and d3.js to visualizations concerning health markers and poverty levels, to assess the health risks facing particular demographics. Data was presented as a CSV from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

Feel free to play around with the indicators as the diplay is interactive.

To visualize different data segments, please select from the various headings of Poverty (%), Age (Median), Household Income (Median), Obesity (%), Smokers (%), and Without Healthcare (%). Each selection shifts the State data represented in circles on the graph. The circles themselves can be hovered over to view the specific values for that state.

Findings: Through this visualization we are able to piece apart the positive correlation between poverty and healthcare. Not only do we see the general upward trend, but when you place a cursor over a state like Texas (TX), we see a high percentage of the population has no healthcare, 24.9%, and that 17.4% of the population lives in poverty. In contrast, we see states such as Massachusetts (MA), that have a lower percentage of their population without healthcare, 4.6%, also have a lower poverty rate, 11.6%.

When displaying data on healthcare and household income we can observe a negative correlation between median household income and the no healthcare rate. States with higher median imcomes have a lower percentage of their population without healthcare, while the opposite is true for those states with lower median income rates. From our previous example, the state of Massachusetts (MA), which has a median household income of $69,160, has a low no healthcare rate of 4.6%. Mississippi (MS), on the other hand, has a median household income of $39,680, and 18.8% of their population has no healthcare insurance.

As you toggle the axes, you will also uncover trends in how Household Income and Obesity rates impact eachother, how Smoking rates vary with age and household income, and more.
